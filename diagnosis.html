          <h2>Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) Tests</h2>
          <br>
          <p class = "p">
            Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a method widely used to rapidly make millions to billions
            of copies (complete copies or partial copies) of a specific DNA sample,
            allowing scientists to take a very small sample of DNA and amplify it (or a part of it)
            to a large enough amount to study in detail.
            <br>
            <br>
            PCR allows for rapid and highly specific diagnosis of infectious diseases,
            including those caused by bacteria or viruses.
            PCR tests have been developed that can detect as little as one viral genome
            among the DNA of over 50,000 host cells.
            Viral DNA can be detected by PCR. The primers used must be specific to the targeted
            sequences in the DNA of a virus, and PCR can be used for diagnostic analyses or
            DNA sequencing of the viral genome. The high sensitivity of PCR permits virus detection
            soon after infection and even before the onset of disease. Such early detection may give
            physicians a significant lead time in treatment. The amount of virus ("viral load")
            in a patient can also be quantified by PCR-based DNA quantitation techniques. <br>
            <br>
            A variant of PCR (RT-PCR) is used for detecting viral RNA rather than DNA:
            in this test the enzyme reverse transcriptase is used to generate a DNA sequence
             which matches the viral RNA; this DNA is then amplified as per the usual PCR method.
             RT-PCR is widely used to detect the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome.

            <br>
            The majority of PCR methods rely on thermal cycling. Thermal cycling exposes reactants to repeated cycles of heating and cooling to permit different temperature-dependent reactions—specifically, DNA melting and enzyme-driven DNA replication. PCR employs two main reagents—primers (which are short single strand DNA fragments known as oligonucleotides that are a complementary sequence to the target DNA region) and a DNA polymerase. In the first step of PCR, the two strands of the DNA double helix are physically separated at a high temperature in a process called nucleic acid denaturation. In the second step, the temperature is lowered and the primers bind to the complementary sequences of DNA. The two DNA strands then become templates for DNA polymerase to enzymatically assemble a new DNA strand from free nucleotides, the building blocks of DNA. As PCR progresses, the DNA generated is itself used as a template for replication, setting in motion a chain reaction in which the original DNA template is exponentially amplified. <br> (Wikipedia, 2021)

            <h2>Lateral Flow Tests (LFT)</h2>
            <br>
            <p class = "p">
              Lateral flow tests are rapid diagnostic tests that may be used at the point-of-care (i.e., with a patient during a clinical consultation). Rapid diagnosis of an infection is important to ensure that patients receive the correct care and when necessary, treatment with appropriate antimicrobial therapy (refer to this post to find out more about what is meant by antimicrobial and more about antimicrobial resistance).<br>
              <br>
              A lateral flow test contains a sophisticated series of antibodies (immuno-) that recognise and capture specific molecules of interest from a clinical sample. For diagnosis of infection these molecules of interest are usually an antigen or antibody. When the clinical sample is mixed with a buffer solution, the molecules of interest, such as ‘bits’ of viral particle (for bits, read antigen), are released into the liquid and move along the strip (-chromatographic) inside an outer plastic casing or cassette. <br>
              <br>
              When a clinical sample contains molecules relevant to the infection of interest, they are captured by antibodies that are free to move along the strip once the test solution has been added. The molecule+antibody complexes move by capillary motion along the strip to where more antibodies have been laid down onto the nitrocellulose strip in an area labelled ‘T’ (for Test). When the molecule+antibody complexes bind to the test area, a change in colour occurs, indicating a positive result.<br>
              <br>
              If a clinical sample does not contain relevant molecules of interest, the test solution moves along the strip, releasing the antibodies as before. In this instance, however, the antibodies don’t have any molecules with which to bind and they carry on their merry way along the strip to be captured only by the control line ‘C’, causing a change in colour in this area of the test strip, indicating a negative result.<br>
              <br>
              In order for a lateral flow test to be valid, the control line must always be present. The control line indicates that the test has been completed properly (sufficient test solution added, correct length of time in which to read the results etc) and explains why the control line is always at the end furthest away from sample addition point.
