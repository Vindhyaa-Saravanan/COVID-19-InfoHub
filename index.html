            Ready to learn more about COVID-19? Read on to uncover essential information
            and interesting facts about the virus that caused a worldwide pandemic!<br>
          </p>
          <br>
          <h2>What is COVID-19?</h2>
          <br>
          <p class = "p">
            Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused
            by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
            The first known case was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.
            The disease has since spread worldwide, leading to an ongoing pandemic.<br>
            <br>
            Symptoms of COVID‑19 are variable and may begin one to fourteen days after exposure to the virus.
            At least a third of people who are infected do not develop noticeable symptoms.
            Of those people who develop symptoms noticeable enough to be classed as patients,
            most (81%) develop mild to moderate symptoms,
            while 14% develop severe symptoms, and 5% suffer critical symptoms.
            Some people continue to experience a range of effects (long COVID) for months after recovery,
            and damage to organs has been observed.<br>
            <br>
            COVID‑19 transmits when people breathe in air contaminated by droplets and small airborne
            particles containing the virus. The risk of breathing these in increase in close proximity and indoors.
            Transmission can also occur if splashed or sprayed with contaminated fluids in the eyes,
            nose or mouth, and, rarely, via contaminated surfaces. People remain contagious for up to 20 days,
            and can spread the virus even if they do not develop symptoms.<br>
            <br>
            Several testing methods have been developed to diagnose the disease.
            Several COVID-19 vaccines have been approved and distributed in various countries, which have initiated mass vaccination campaigns.
            Other preventive measures include physical or social distancing, quarantining,
            ventilation of indoor spaces, covering coughs and sneezes, hand washing.
            The use of face masks or coverings has been recommended in public settings to minimize the risk of transmissions.
            While work is underway to develop drugs that inhibit the virus, the primary treatment is symptomatic.
            Management involves the treatment of symptoms, supportive care, isolation, and experimental measures.

          <h2>What are the symptoms of COVID-19?</h2>
          <br>
          <p class = "p">
            Some common symptoms that have been specifically linked to COVID-19 include:
          <br>
            • shortness of breath<br>
            • a cough that gets more severe over time<br>
            • congestion or runny nose, especially with the Delta variant<br>
            • fever<br>
            • chills<br>
            • fatigue<br>
          <br>
            Less common symptoms include:
          <br>
            • shivering<br>
            • sore throat<br>
            • headache<br>
            • muscle aches and pains<br>
            • loss of taste or smell<br>
            • a stuffy or runny nose<br>
            • gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting<br>
            • discoloration of fingers or toes<br>
            • pink eye<br>
            • rash<br>
          <br>
            However, individuals with COVID-19 may have some, all, or none of the above symptoms.

            Even though coronavirus was initially thought of as a respiratory illness, we know that it can affect other organs and systems in your body. The infection (and the way your body responds to it) may affect your heart, circulatory system, brain, kidneys, liver, gastrointestinal system, and other systems.
            COVID-19 has long lasting effects on the following body parts:<br>
          <br>

            <a id="Brain"> • <strong>Brain:</strong> Studies now suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can infect astrocytes,
              a type of cell that’s abundant in the brain and has many functions.
              “Astrocytes do quite a lot that supports normal brain function,”
              including providing nutrients to neurons to keep them working,
              says Arnold Kriegstein, a neurologist at the University of California, San Francisco.
              Infected astrocytes could explain some of the neurological symptoms associated with COVID-19,
              especially fatigue, depression and ‘brain fog’, which includes confusion and forgetfulness,
              argues Kriegstein. “Those kinds of symptoms may not be reflective of neuronal damage,
              but could be reflective of dysfunctions of some sort.
              That could be consistent with astrocyte vulnerability.”<br>
              <br>
              Evidence has also accumulated that SARS-CoV-2 can affect the brain by reducing blood flow to it —
              impairing neurons’ function and ultimately killing them.
              Pericytes are cells found on small blood vessels called capillaries throughout the body —
              including in the brain. A February preprint reported that SARS-CoV-2 could infect pericyte-like
              cells in brain organoids.<br>
              <br>
              There is also growing evidence that some neurological symptoms and damage
              are the result of the body’s own immune system overreacting and even misfiring
              after encountering the coronavirus.<br>
            (Nature, 2021)</a> <br>
              <br>

            <a id="Heart"> • <strong>Heart:</strong> COVID-19 can make blood cells more likely to clump up and form clots.
              While large clots can cause heart attacks and strokes,
              much of the heart damage caused by COVID-19 is believed to stem from very small clots
              that block tiny blood vessels (capillaries) in the heart muscle.<br>(Mayo Clinic, 2021)<br>
              <br>
              Covid-19 can cause fever and inflammation, which places extra stress on the heart
              as your body fights the infection. This can also cause your heart rate to become fast or irregular.
              If the infection is severe enough that it damages the lungs, this can reduce the amount of oxygen
              that reaches the heart. As the virus and the immune response to it can also damage the cells that
              line the blood vessels, this can also cause clots in the blood vessels that supply the lungs and
              limiting the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the heart.This extra demand on the heart,
              paired with the lack of oxygen and nutrients, can cause damage to the heart muscle.<br>
              <br>
              We know that patients in hospital with severe cases of coronavirus who have heart muscle damage
               (as shown by blood tests) have a higher risk of dying.
              In some patients, further tests called echocardiograms have found that
              the heart isn’t pumping as well as it should (heart failure). <br>(British Heart Foundation, 2021)<br>
            </a> <br>

            <a id="Lungs"> • <strong>Lungs:</strong> In severe cases of Covid-19, the infection moves down the respiratory tract
               to the lungs, where it can cause pneumonia. If you get pneumonia, your lungs might not be able
               to supply as much oxygen to the bloodstream, so you may need hospital treatment.
               It’s now also understood that one of the ways coronavirus can prevent the lungs from working
               properly is through damaging small blood vessels in the lungs. This can cause blood clots
               and fluid to accumulate in the lungs, which means they are less able to get oxygen into the body.<br>
               (Mayo Clinic, 2021)</a><br>
            <br>
            <a id="Kidney"> • <strong>Kidney:</strong>
              The virus itself infects the cells of the kidney. Kidney cells have receptors
              that enable the new coronavirus to attach to them, invade, and make copies of itself,
              potentially damaging those tissues. Similar receptors are found on cells of the lungs
              and heart, where the new coronavirus has been shown to cause injury.

              COVID-19 can also weaken blood vessels and cause them to leak,
            which contributes to potentially long-lasting problems with the liver and kidneys.

          <h2>Who's at risk?</h2>
          <br>
          <p class = "p">
            You’re at high risk for contracting SARS-CoV-2 if you come into contact with someone who’s carrying it, especially if you’ve been exposed to their saliva or been near them when they’ve coughed, sneezed, or talked.<br />
            Without taking proper preventive measures, you’re also at high risk if you live with someone who has contracted the virus, or are providing home care for someone who has contracted the virus<br>
            Older adults and people with certain health conditions have a higher risk of severe complications if they contract the virus. These health conditions include:
            <br>
              • cancer<br>
              • serious heart conditions, such as heart failure, coronary artery disease (CAD), and cardiomyopathy<br>
              • chronic kidney disease<br>
              • chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)<br>
              • obesity, a condition that develops in people with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher<br>
              • sickle cell anemia<br>
              • a weakened immune system from a solid organ transplant<br>
              • Type 2 diabetes<br>
